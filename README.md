# UFOs
Finding UFOs with Javascript

## Overview of Project

To create a website that allows the user to analyze UFO sighting, with options to filter and isolate multiple criteria.

## Results

After opening the website, we are greeted with the following page:

![UFOs1](githubcomDavidFGitH)

To start filtering all the data available, we would scroll down to where we see all the options for filtering:

![UFOs2](githubcomDavidFGitH)

Currently, we can scroll down the page to see all the data currently available to us, but in order to filter the data we must enter values into the filter. In order to engage the filter, we will enter a value into one of the blank filters as shown below:

![UFOs3](githubcomDavidFGitH)

After hitting enter, we can see that the values in the table included have now changed to just include the values that we entered in the filter.

![UFOs4](githubcomDavidFGitH)

We can further refine this search by adding values into other empty filter fields:

![UFOs5](githubcomDavidFGitH)

If we ever need to clear the filters, we just delete what was entered into the filter and the table will reset itself to our needs.

## Summary

Overall, the website in it's current form provides a basic options to filter the data to isolate the data of UFO sightings using the preset filters and criteria provided by the website. However, just filtering the data doesn't offer a lot of value in terms of analysis, and it becomes difficult to find the scale of importance for things like specific cities which might experience more sightings than others, or whether there might be patterns that emerge, or what the pool of options and values are in the data collected. There are lots of options to add more functionality to the website, whether it is providing a dropdown in the filter instead of having to type exactly what to filter for providing more convenient ways for filtering as well as showing all the options that are available. Adding a count of results could also help a lot in terms of easily quantifying the results of specifying criteria.
